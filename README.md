# EV Charging Station App

## Features

- **Charging Station Locator**: Users can find nearby EV charging stations and view details.
- **Start and Stop Charging**: Interface to initiate charging sessions.
- **User-Friendly UI**: Easy navigation and interaction with the core features.

## Future Enhancements

### Functionality

- **Pagination**: Implement pagination for lists using RTK Query to handle large datasets efficiently (with APIs that offer paginated sets of data).
- **Maps Integration**: Integrate a mapping solution like React Native Maps to display charging station locations. Fetch results based on Geoloaction.
- **User Notifications**: Implement push notifications for charging session updates, reminders, and promotions.

### Testing

- **End-to-End Testing**: Incorporate Detox for end-to-end testing to simulate user behavior and interactions.
- **Expanded Unit and Integration Testing**: Utilize React Native Testing Library for more comprehensive unit and integration tests.

### Performance and Scalability

- **Caching Mechanism**: Implement caching strategies for API responses to improve app performance and device storage for potential offline usage.
- **Load Balancing**: Ensure backend APIs are capable of handling increased traffic with load balancing techniques.

### Security

- **Secure API Communication**: Implement OAuth for secure API interactions and user authentication.
- **Data Encryption**: Use encryption for sensitive user data.

### CI/CD

- **Automated Pipelines**: Set up CI/CD pipelines for automated testing and deployment.

- **Staging and Production Environments**: Maintain separate staging and production environments to ensure safe deployment cycles.

### User Experience

- **Accessibility**: Enhance accessibility features to accommodate all users, including those with disabilities.
- **Internationalization**: Implement multi-language support for wider accessibility.

### Analytics

- **Usage Analytics**: Integrate an analytics solution to gather insights on user behavior and app performance.

This is a [**React Native**](https://reactnative.dev) project, bootstrapped using [`@react-native-community/cli`](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli).

# Getting Started

> **Note**: Make sure you have completed the [React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) instructions till "Creating a new application" step, before proceeding.

## Step 1: Start the Metro Server

First, you will need to start **Metro**, the JavaScript _bundler_ that ships _with_ React Native.

To start Metro, run the following command from the _root_ of your React Native project:

```bash
# using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

## Step 2: Start your Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your _Android_ or _iOS_ app:

### For Android

```bash
# using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

### For iOS

```bash
# using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see your new app running in your _Android Emulator_ or _iOS Simulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

This is one way to run your app — you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.

## Step 3: Modifying your App

Now that you have successfully run the app, let's modify it.

1. Open `App.tsx` in your text editor of choice and edit some lines.
2. For **Android**: Press the <kbd>R</kbd> key twice or select **"Reload"** from the **Developer Menu** (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (on Window and Linux) or <kbd>Cmd ⌘</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (on macOS)) to see your changes!

   For **iOS**: Hit <kbd>Cmd ⌘</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd> in your iOS Simulator to reload the app and see your changes!

## Congratulations! :tada:

You've successfully run and modified your React Native App. :partying_face:
